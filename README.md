Stop Azure Virtual Machine using Azure Automation Runbook
=========================================================

            

Demonstrates stopping all Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine in a specific Azure subscription. The script could be associated with the new Azure Automation Scheduler to stop Virtual Machines at specific time. Great for developers for saving on Azure Compute,
 if they forget to shutdown the virtual machines Friday afternoon....


You have to define an Azure Connection and Azure Certificate under Azure Automation Assets. You should also change the references within the script to point to the correct Asset names.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
